# dashboard
A dashboard is a visual representation of data that provides a consolidated and interactive view of key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and other relevant information within a single, centralized interface. Dashboards are designed to facilitate quick and informed decision-making by presenting data in a comprehensible and accessible format.

This HTML code is a simple web page that includes a clock displaying the current time and a navigation section for a basic email-related application. Let's break down the code and describe its components:

### HTML Structure:

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).

- **`<html lang="en">`**: The root element of the HTML document, specifying the language as English.

- **`<head>` Section**:
  - **Meta Tags**: Meta tags provide information about the document. In this case, they specify character set, viewport settings, and compatibility.
  - **`<title>`**: Sets the title of the web page.

- **`<body>` Section**:
  - **Time and Date Display**: Two `div` elements with inline styles are used to display the current time and date. The time is updated every second using JavaScript.
  
  - **Clock Script**: A simple JavaScript script inside the `<script>` tag fetches the current time and updates the displayed time every second.
  
  - **Navigation Section**: A container with two buttons (Read Mail and Send Mail) is provided. These buttons link to corresponding PHP files (`read_mail.php` and `send_mail.php`).

  - **Logout Link**: A link to "index.php" is provided with the label "Logout."

### JavaScript Clock Script:

The clock script updates the time element every second. It performs the following steps:
1. It retrieves the current time using the `Date` object.
2. It extracts hours, minutes, and seconds from the current time.
3. It ensures that minutes and seconds are displayed with leading zeros if they are less than 10.
4. It updates the content of the `timeElem` element with the formatted time.

### Bootstrap:

The code uses Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to style the buttons. The Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files are included from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

### Usage and Working:

1. **Display Time and Date**: The web page displays the current time and date. The time is updated in real-time.

2. **Navigation Section**: Users can navigate to different sections of an email-related application by clicking on the "Read Mail" and "Send Mail" buttons. The buttons are styled using Bootstrap classes.

3. **Logout Link**: Users can log out by clicking on the "Logout" link, which presumably redirects to the "index.php" page.

In summary, this code provides a simple web page with a real-time clock and navigation links for an email-related application. It uses HTML for structure, JavaScript for dynamic time updating, and Bootstrap for styling. The PHP files linked in the navigation buttons are assumed to handle email-related functionality.
